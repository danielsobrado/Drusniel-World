 * light, so the wind is *seen* crossing the field as travelling bright bands.
 *
 * The ambient layer writes `weight` once a frame — the meadow region weight ×
 * preset × strength, eased like every other surface term — and the meadow grass
 * material reads it. At zero the material adds nothing visible.
