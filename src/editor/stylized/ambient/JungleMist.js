/**
 * Humid ground mist between the jungle trees — after grass-test's jungle mist
 * (`src/rendering/jungleMist.js`, applied in `CinematicPipeline.#jungleMist`).
 *
 * THE DONOR, AND WHY IT CANNOT BE PORTED AS WRITTEN
 *
 * The donor runs the mist in the post pass. To do so it reconstructs each
 * pixel's view ray and — from the *resolved depth buffer*
 * (`perspectiveDepthToViewZ(stage.depth…)`) — the distance to the surface the
 * pixel shows, then blends the mist over the *scene colour texture*. Both are
 * viewport reads this project refuses where they can be avoided.
 *
 * WHAT IS PORTED INSTEAD, AND WHY IT NEEDS NEITHER
 *
 * The donor's own comment says the reason it is a post effect is a *cost*: as a
 * fog node it "ran for every fragment of the jungle's alpha-tested foliage,
 * whose overdraw defeats early depth rejection". It is not that the maths needs
 * the framebuffer — it does not. The density falls off exponentially with height
 * above one ground level, so the integral along the ray has a closed form: one
 * `exp` pair and one noise tap, no march. The *only* framebuffer input is
 * `length`, the distance to the surface the pixel shows.
 *
 * In a material that value is free. `cameraPosition.distance(positionWorld)` is
 * the distance to the fragment being shaded — the very surface `length` was
 * resolved from depth to reach, and the same quantity the valley fog port
 * marches toward (`mist/ValleyFogShading.js`). So the closed form ports exactly,
 * with `cameraPosition` standing in for the donor's `eye`, `worldPosition` for
 * its surface point, and a `ground` node for its eased terrain height under the
 * view. Nothing is read: no depth buffer, no scene colour texture, no planar
 * reflection, no cube probe. It is a pure function of the ray, the ground level
 * and the clock.
 *
 * The cost argument flips back the other way — a material node runs once per
 * shaded fragment rather than once per screen pixel — but that is the trade this
 * project's rule makes deliberately, and the closed form is *cheaper* than the
 * valley fog port's six-step march: no loop, no height-texture fetches. It is
 * gated three ways: `enabled` (this returns `null`, so the material keeps the
 * colour it already had), a runtime region weight (`weight`, the ambient layer's
 * `jungle` weight × preset × strength) below which a single branch skips the
 * whole thing, and the quality share.
 *
 * The sky is left alone, as in the donor: the mist is blended into the ground and
 * foliage materials a pixel actually shows, and scene fog already leaves the sky
 * dome.
 *
 * HOME: this is the same kind of node graph as the valley fog — a quality-gated,
 * region-weighted volumetric mist blended into a material as
 * `mix(base, color, amount)` — so it is deliberately kept to the ambient file
 * family's shape (config + nodes in one file, like `BlownStreaks`/`FrostShading`)
 * rather than split across `mist/`. Its authority, the region weight, the ground
 * level and the strength, is the ambient layer's, so it lives where its driver
 * lives.
