 * The meadow's wind on an authored ground detail — grass tufts, jungle grasses,

 * Authored tufts were drawn rigid, and because their density is weighted per
 * chunk and per regional district, whole patches of the sward stood still while
 * the procedural blades round them swayed: the wind looked different by chunk.
 * This bends a tuft with the same travelling wave, clock and world field as the
 * meadow blades (meadowBladeShape's primary wave), rooted at its base and
 * growing toward its top, so a gust front crosses tufts and blades together.
 *
 * `positionLocal` here is already placed by the instance matrix (the renderer
 * applies instancing before `positionNode`), so the tuft's own height comes from
 * `positionGeometry`.

 * @param {object} wind `stylizedSurface.wind` (strength, speed, frequency, lean)
