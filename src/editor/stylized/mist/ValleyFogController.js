/**
 * The valley mist's live state: one camera-local height patch — the same
 * `LocalGroundHeight` the ambient particles already sit on, not a second field —
 * and the uniforms every shaded terrain fragment reads.
 *
 * The patch is what makes the march possible at all: this streamed world has no
 * whole-map height texture to bind, and a terrain slot's own height field is only
 * a 128 m chunk the shader cannot index by world position. A single patch around
 * the camera is bounded, cheap, and shared by every fragment, and the mist fades
 * out before the patch edge so the boundary never shows.
 *
 * The caller drives it once a frame with the camera focus and the sky's current
 * sun, fog colour and region weight. With no config it resolves to null and the
 * material builds no fog at all.
