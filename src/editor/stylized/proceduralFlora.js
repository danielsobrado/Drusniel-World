/**
 * Procedural geometry for the small things that live on a shore — after
 * grass-test's beach scatter, starfish and coastal groundcover.
 *
 * The donor builds these in code rather than shipping them, and that is the whole
 * reason this port is worth doing: a starfish is ten triangles, a leaf is two, and
 * none of them needs an asset, an atlas, a texture or a residency entry. They ride
 * the ground-detail layer's existing instancing, so a shore costs one draw call per
 * prototype and nothing to load.
 *
 * Every shape here is authored at unit scale — a radius-1 footprint, or a
 * metre-long twig — and the layer's per-instance scale does the rest. Nothing
 * reads a random source: variation across instances comes from the placement's own
 * deterministic scale and rotation, so a chunk's shore is identical every rebuild.
 *
 * Triangle budgets, because these are meant to be placed in their hundreds: the
 * star is 10, the shell 16, the leaf 2, and a twig is 8 segments of a 5-sided tube.
