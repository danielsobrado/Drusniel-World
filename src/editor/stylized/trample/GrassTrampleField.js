/**
 * Where feet have been, as a player-centred texture the grass reads (after
 * grass-test's `InteractionMap`).
 *
 * The donor keeps a CPU byte array and scrolls it by hand each frame. This is
 * the same field with the per-pixel work on the GPU: one small render target
 * holds the state, a fullscreen TSL pass reprojects it when the window moves,
 * applies the recovery decay and presses this frame's contacts, and the result
 * is copied back into the target materials sample. The *decisions* -- when the
 * pass is worth running, how far a texel has recovered, which texels a contact
 * dirties -- are all in `trampleMath`, so they are pinned by tests rather than
 * only visible in a browser, and this file is the plumbing around them.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately not the donor's:
 *
 * - Everything on the wire is *window-local*. A canonical coordinate on an
 *   imported world is millions of metres from the origin, where float32 cannot
 *   resolve a 0.3 m texel; a contact uploaded as `contact - windowCentre` is a
 *   small difference either side of the UV seam, and the same difference is what
 *   the fragment shader computes from its own uv. The donor is a fixed map and
 *   never had to think about this.
 * - The decay is per *second*, not per frame. The donor's 0.94 a frame is 0.94^60
 *   a second at 60 fps; expressing it per second is what lets the pass run on a
 *   capped cadence without the footprints lasting longer when the cap bites.
 *
 * Lifecycle matches the rest of this project: allocation is transactional (a
 * failure disposes every partial resource before it throws), reconfiguration
 * releases the old targets in one place, and `dispose()` is idempotent because
 * the surface view calls it on a teardown path that can also be reached from a
 * failed boot.
