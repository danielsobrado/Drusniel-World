 * A ridged multifractal: each octave folds value noise into sharp crests, and a
 * crest in one octave strengthens the next, so detail gathers along ridgelines
 * instead of spreading evenly. Wavelengths stay well above the 2 m cell, so no
 * octave aliases on the terrain grid.
 *
 * Two finer terms ride on top of that massif, both from the donor's alpine
 * landform:
 *  - couloirs, the steep rock chutes down a flank between its ribs; and
 *  - crest notches, the saddles cut into a ridge line.
 * Both are additive: a depth of zero, or a world imported before them, leaves
 * that term off without touching the crests underneath.
